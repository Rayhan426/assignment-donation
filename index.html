                <p class="donate-plan-details"> Do people consider alternative uses of money (i.e., opportunity cost)
                    when asked to donate to a
                    charitable cause? To answer this question, we examined the effect of providing versus not
                    providing
                    participants with an opportunity cost reminder when they are asked to donate money to causes
                    with
                    identified and non-identified victims. The results of two studies show that when making one-time
                    donation decisions, people become less willing to donate to charity when reminded of opportunity
                    cost, but mainly for non-identified victims.</p>
